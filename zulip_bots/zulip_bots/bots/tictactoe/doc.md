# Tic-Tac-Toe Bot

This bot allows you to play tic-tac-toe in a private message with the bot.
Multiple games can simultaneously be played by different users, each playing
against the computer.

The bot only responds to messages starting with @mention of the bot(botname).

## Setup
This bot does not require any special setup. Just run it according to the
instructions in [this guide](https://zulip.com/api/running-bots#running-a-bot).

## Commands
* `@mention-botname new` - start a new game (but not if you are already
playing a game.) You must type this first to start playing!

* `@mention-botname help` - return a help message.

* `@mention-botname quit` - quit the current game.

* `@mention-botname <coordinate>` - make a move at the entered coordinate.
For example, `@mention-botname 1,1` . After this, the bot will make its
move, or declare the game over if the user or bot has won.

Coordinates are entered in a (row, column) format. Numbering is from top to
bottom and left to right.
Here are the coordinates of each position. When entering coordinates, parentheses
and spaces are optional.

(1, 1)  | (1, 2) | (1, 3)

(2, 1)  | (2, 2) | (2, 3)

(3, 1)  | (3, 2) | (3, 3)

Invalid commands will result in an "I don't understand" response from the bot,
with a suggestion to type `@mention-botname help`.
